I am a journalist and a book author. 
I am interested in exploring the world from all sides. 
I also enjoy cooking. I have been living with my family in the Granada region for two years and in SalobreÃ±a for a few
months. One of the most wonderful places in the world. We come from Poland.
We are getting to know Andalusia and especially the Costa Tropical with Escobar the dog. He also flew
here from Poland and praises the decision very much.
