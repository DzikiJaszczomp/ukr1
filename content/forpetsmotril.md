Pets guide

Motril

If you decide to live in Motril, it is better to choose the coastal district rather than the city centre. Especially if we have a dog. The former offers many more opportunities for walks with your pet, not least by the sea. It is not insignificant that there is a dog beach - El Cable Beach.
Motril offers a full service for our pets. There are quite a few veterinary clinics and surgeries, as well as pet shops.

Dogs beach

Motril –  Playa El Cable (Playacan)
Playa El Cable is in the urban area, just to the west of the port.  It is also referred to as Playacan, which is short for Playa Canina or dog beach.  This beach is an officially recognized dog beach.  It is a long beach of more than two kilometers in length, but there is a designated 400m area specifically for dogs!  The beach is composed of dark sand and gravel, clean waters, and a moderate swell.
Hours
Summer season only (July 1 – September 30), there are no time limits to enjoy the Playa El Cable dog beach.
