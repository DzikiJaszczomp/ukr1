Salobreña Costa Tropical veterinary clinics, pet shops, dogs park, dogs beaches

Salobreña

Salobreña can safely be described as the dog capital of the Costa Tropical. Not just any dog, as there are plenty of cats too. Conditions for animals are very good in this small, extremely charming town. Especially when it comes to dog walking. There are plenty of places where they can run freely, in addition to the company of other dogs, as you meet them at every turn. 
A serious drawback of Salobreña is the lack of a beach for dogs. For this, you can freely enter the parks. Two veterinary clinics operate here and you can shop for your pet in the numerous markets.

Dog washing station
At the Repsol Service Station in Salobreña you can find a grooming tub for dogs. The price is 4 euros and it includes shampoo, a deworming shampoo and drying. The bathtub has a self-cleaning system for sanitary measures.

Dogs park
There’s a dog park at Plaza de la Libertad. There you can find toboggans, tubes, zig zags and different tools for our animals to do some physical activity. It has a fence around it, which means the animal can’t escape. Location:
