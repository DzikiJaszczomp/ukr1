Costa Tropical fruit route 
Start point: Salobreña bus station 
The walk takes about 3 hours round trip.  

Costa Tropical is a benchmark in Europe for subtropical crops.  
The region's climate is one of a kind in Europe and was found to be perfect for growing these fruits:  
mango, chirimoya, custard apple, avocado  
and loquats; and other more exotic ones,  
such as guavas, lychees, dragon fruit, star fruit  and kumquat. 
The unique climate of the Costa Tropical  is a result of the direct contact of the land  with the Mediterranean Sea,  
and the fact that it is protected by  
the mountains of Sierra Nevada and Lújar  from the north winds and from  
the influence of the winds that come f rom the northernmost part of Africa.  This creates a subtropical microclimate  with more than 300 days of sunshine  a year and an average yearly temperature  of 20 degrees Celsius.  
Enjoy a walking tour from Salobreña  to the town of Lobres,  
along the trail of tropical fruit plantations. 
The tour starts at the bus station.  
We can turn on Google maps on our phone,  we found them helpful.  
Facing the station we turn right.  
We walk down the street, passing 
the sports facilities, on the left.  

We walk for about 20 minutes coming to  
a dried up river.  
It is necessary to cross to the other side. 


Then walk down to the right to the fruit orchards.  Walking along the river  
you will reach the Guadalfeo River.  
Walk along the riverbed.  
Along the way you will pass former  
equipment used to regulate the river.  
During the walk you will pass  
a working sugar factory (Azucarera Montero),  on the left. 
Walk all the way along the river,  
and then turn into a residential area (calle Murillo).  Through this street you will reach 
the centre of Lobres. 

If you want to walk to Cueva del Capitan  (an extra 1.5 hours to get there and back),  turn right in the town (as shown in the photo).

Cross the viaduct over the motorway.  
Then walk straight ahead to the road.  
Take the same route back.

Cueva del Capitan 

Walking around the centre, 
after a short while you will reach  
the main square.  
Then walk towards the church,  
after the temple turn 
slightly to the right, uphill.


We reach the road, pass the crossroads 
and turn left into a dirt road.

We now walk along the orchards.  
We reach a tarmac road. Turn left and walk towards Salobreña. 

Google maps will show us the way through  Monte Hacho mirador.  
Unfortunately, we won't get there. 
The road is fenced off, apparently illegally.
