Where to stay

accommodation in Costa Tropical, apartments, hotels Motril, Almuñécar, Salobreña
If you dream of all-inclusive holidays in big hotel resorts then there are better places than the Costa Tropical, such as the
neighbouring Costa del Sol.
This is not to say that there are not large hotels with well-developed facilities. However, there are very few, and in some
resorts none at all.
If this is an added incentive for you to come to the Costa Tropical, read on.
If you prefer to immerse yourself in the local environment from hotel life then the Costa Tropical is for you. Especially if
you like local flavours, the beauty of the landscape, the sights. Beaches too, of course, but more intimate, charming ones.
As far as tourist accommodation is concerned, flats for rent dominate here, the offer is large, but when thinking of
travelling in July and especially in August you need to book accommodation in advance. Guest houses, hostels and small
hotels, located near the sea, are also an interesting proposition.
Campsites are also very popular.

Each of the Costa Tropical destinations has its own specificity. Motril is a port town, administrative and economic centre.
The town has a seaside tourist district with a rich infrastructure and nice beaches. There is also a golf course.
Salobreña is perhaps the most charming town with its castle on a rock. The town invites you for a more intimate holiday.
The infrastructure is very well developed and the town is very well maintained. Flats in small buildings and small hotels
predominate.
Almuñécar is the largest tourist centre with the most developed infrastructure. The other towns are charming, intimate
tourist destinations.
