***Flavours of the Costa Tropical Rum (RON)***

Rum production is inextricably linked to sugar cane cultivation and sugar production.
Sugar production on the Costa Tropical was started by the Moors. Because of the warm tropical climate
and access to water, this area was perfect for sugar cane cultivation.
In the 13th Century the Muslim Geographer, Yakut, wrote of the vast plantations in the Vega del
Guadalfeo, which enjoyed a unique climate, in the whole of Europe: sugar cane is not resistant to frost
and sub-zero temperatures and must have bountiful water in the periods of maximum growth
(spring/summer) – here both conditions were met.
The Moors created sugar plantations up and down the now Costa de Sol and Costa Tropical that were very
successful. They produced products such as sugar, dark and light honeys and rum.
Until more recently, sugar cane production was a very important part of the local economy, as it had been
for over the last 1000 years.
By 1860 there were seven industrialised sugar factories in Motril. By 1985 only one factory remained (La
Azucarera del Guadalfeo) and the last crop was harvested in 2006; 35,000 tonnes of cane were harvested
and 3,000 tonnes of sugar were produced, which were consumed in the local region.
The great sugar industry no longer exists today. Some former sugar factories have been turned into
cultural centres, while others produce rum using traditional methods.

The Montero rum factory is located in Motril, more specifically between Salobreña and Motril. The
factory was founded in 1963 by a family with a great sugar tradition. It is the only one in Europe that you
can visit, taste the liquors and learn about the production process.
Montero rum is produced using traditional technology. It is matured in barrels. The Solera method is used
in the production and maturation of the liquor, as is the case with the three production of Jerez wine and
brandy.
It is not a strictly industrial production, more of an artisanal one, and the rums are sold on the local market
and sent for export on individual orders.
