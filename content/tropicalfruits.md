# Flavours of the Costa Tropical
## Fruits

The Costa Tropical tastes and smells of tropical fruit, wine, traditional rum, the sea and its fruits.

### Costa Tropical fruits

It is the only place in Europe where tropical fruit is grown. Costa Tropical is a benchmark in Europe for
subtropical crops. The region's climate is one of a kind in Europe and was found to be perfect for growing
these fruits: mango, chirimoya, custard apple, avocado and loquats; and other more exotic ones, such as
guavas, lychees, dragon fruit, star fruit
and kumquat.

The unique climate of the Costa Tropical is a result of the direct contact of the land with the
Mediterranean Sea, and the fact that it is protected by the mountains of Sierra Nevada and Lújar
from the north winds and from the influence of the winds that come from the northernmost part of Africa.
This creates a subtropical microclimate.

Where to buy local tropical fruit?
Preferably in shops - fruteria, directly on the farms and in markets – mercado municipal

#### Chirimoya

The fruit showpiece of Costa Tropical is the chirimoya.
Mark Twain wrote that cherimoya is the tastiest fruit that man has tasted. This heart-shaped fruit is as
sweet as pudding, which is why the English call it a custard apple - meaning an apple flavoured with
custard.

Cherimoya tastes like sweet custard pudding, although sour notes are also noticeable. Despite its
sweetness, the fruit is not calorific. Cherimoya has many valuable properties. It is a source of vitamins
and minerals. It contains antioxidants and fibre, exhibits antibacterial activity and has anti-cancer
properties.

How to eat chirimoya?
The fruit should be soft. If you buy a hard one, it will soften after 2-3 days. When cut in half, it can be
eaten with a spoon.

##### Avocado

This is also a speciality of the Costa Tropical. Avocados are among the most widely grown fruit and
vegetables in the region. Avocados originated in Mexico and were known as early as 7,000 years ago.
Avocados lower cholesterol thanks to their oleic acid content, and the potassium they contain regulates
blood pressure.

###### Mango

A characteristic fruit of the Costa Tropical is also the mango.
Mangoes are low in calories and contain many valuable nutrients.
To choose a mango that is ripe and sweet, it is necessary to pay attention to the appearance of its skin. The
most important thing is the colour: green indicates unripe and intense red indicates overripe. The best fruit
to eat will be the one that will slightly yield when pressed. A ripe mango releases a pleasant fragrance.
How to peel a mango?
Place the fruit on a cutting board. Peel the sides away from the stone. Cut the peeled pieces into a grid.
Turn the flesh inside out.

**Papaya**

It is a plant species found in tropical and subtropical areas. It is native to Central America and southern
Mexico.
The ripe fruit has a yellow-orange skin colour. The flesh is orange.Unripe fruits are hard and the skin is
green.
The fruit, leaves as well as the seeds of the papaya contain large amounts of valuable nutrients. Papaya
contains various chemical compounds known primarily for their antioxidant properties, including rutin,
quercetin, papain, caffeic acid, tocopherol or kemferol.
Papaya flesh is rich in vitamins and minerals. Its peel is also edible. You can eat the fruit raw. They have a
sweet, delicate flavour. They are ideal as an ingredient in smoothies, sorbets or exotic salads. They are
also used for preserves (e.g. jams, marmalades, juices), canning or candying.
Papaya seeds are also edible. In appearance, they resemble peppercorns. They are quite bitter and
pungent.

**Kumquat**

This fruit is native to Southeast Asia. Its name in Cantonese means “golden orange”.
Kumquat fruits grow on evergreen, small trees or shrubs. The kumquat is very similar to an orange in
appearance, but is much smaller than it.
It is the only citrus fruit that can be eaten "with the peel".
Unlike oranges, grapefruit or mandarins, kumquats have a thin, sweet peel and a tangy, slightly tart centre.
Fresh kumquat tastes best if it is gently rolled between the fingers before being eaten, as this way the peel
releases the essential oils.
This small fruit contains many nutrients and vitamins essential for the proper functioning of our bodies.
The fruit is rich in immune-supporting vitamin C , fibre (6.5 grams per serving) and plant compounds
including flavonoids, phytosterols and essential oils.

**Lichis**

It is a plant with beautiful and colourful floral calyxes that fruit wonderfully. For this reason, the lychee
adorned the gardens of the Chinese emperors themselves. The fruit of the lychee is also known as the
Chinese plum. The fruit has been cultivated in China for almost 4,000 years.
Lychee fruit contains many valuable ingredients such as vitamins and minerals C, E, K B6, niacin,
riboflavin, thiamin, folic acid, calcium, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, manganese,
copper.
Lychees can be eaten fresh, or they can be used to make a variety of preserves and drinks. They can also
be used in seafood dishes, fruit salads, meats, fish, as well as in juices, syrups and compotes. Serve with
liqueur, cream or ice cream.

**Pitahaya**

Another name is dragon fruit. Pitahaya is the fruit of many varieties of cacti native to Mexico and Central
America.
The edible flowers are large, white, intensely fragrant and only bloom at night, which is why they are also
called 'moon flowers'. Pitahayas are counted among the world's most beautiful fruits.
The flesh of dragon fruit is refreshingly sweet and very juicy. Interestingly, the low temperature brings out
their flavour brilliantly, which is why they usually become an ingredient in frozen drinks and ice cream
desserts. When you decide to buy a dragon fruit, choose pieces with a smooth , uniform skin, without any
lumps or discolouration. A suitable pitahaya should be springy and slightly bend under pressure.
How to eat? Wash the heavily cooled fruit under running water and wipe it with a kitchen towel. Then
simply cut it in half and scoop out the sweet flesh with a spoon.

**Guayaba, Guava**

Guava is a tropical plant native to South America. The tree grows to a height of about 9 metres, flowers
up to twice a year and the flowers it produces are white, quite large and have a very intense fragrance.
There are many varieties of guava. They differ mainly in the colour of the fruit - its skin can be green,
yellow, orange or red.
Guava has a very good effect on health, and its regular consumption has many benefits.
Guava can be eaten raw, without any preparation. It just needs to be washed, cut in half and the flesh
scooped out of the centre. The fruit is also used as an addition to juices, desserts, compotes, drinks and
cocktails.

One of the more popular desserts that can be prepared using guavas is the so-called 'el bocadillo de
guayaba', a specific type of jam. To make it, you will need two kilos of guava fruit, sugar (twice as much
as the mousse you obtain from the fruit), a little orange juice, and a glass of water. To begin, clean and cut
the fruit into smaller pieces, then pour water over it and boil it. Drain off the cooking juice and combine
the remaining mousse with the sugar, add the orange juice and simmer over low heat until the mixture
becomes thick. Transfer the hot mixture to a dish sprinkled with sugar. The top is also sprinkled with
sugar and allowed to cool, after which the dessert is cut into cubes.



**Carambola**

The carambola, or star fruit, is native to Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
It has a delicate, shiny, smooth and thin skin with a dark yellow colour. When cut crosswise, it resembles
a star in cross-section.
There are many ways carambola can be consumed. The fruit is usually associated with decorating
beverages, cocktails or juices. It can be eaten raw or after heat treatment. In its raw form, it can be used as
a decoration, but also as an ingredient in all kinds of drinks, smoothies and purees. In turn, in the cooked
version, it can be used to prepare pudding, jam or cake. This star-shaped fruit can also be used as an
ingredient in salads.
You also need to make sure that the star fruit is ripe, otherwise it will be sour. Ripeness is indicated
primarily by colour and the level of hardness. It must be all yellow, with only a small amount of green. It
also cannot be too mature. The yellower the fruit, the softer and therefore overripe it is.

**Oranges, mandarins, bananas**
On the Costa Tropical, we encounter orange trees every step of the way. The cultivation of mandarins is
also very popular. Banana cultivation is an interesting feature, and one place also grows coffee.
