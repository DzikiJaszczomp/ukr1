# Costa Tropical wines

Spain is the largest producer and exporter of wine in Europe. The country's spirits are available in almost
every country on the continent. Around a third of Europe's total vineyards are located in the country.
Viticulture in the Iberian Peninsula has a very long tradition, dating back 3-4,000 years before Christ. The
activity became commercially important in the 10th century BC, when the area in the southern part of
present-day Spain belonged to the Phoenicians and later to the Carthaginians. In Roman times, wine
exports from the Andalusian and Catalan areas were already highly developed, with ships taking wine to
Italy, Gaul, Britain and even to Normandy and the Germanic lands. Modern Spanish winemaking was

born in the early 20th century, after the phylloxera scourge was eradicated, but its heyday was in the mid-
1980s.

The most popular varieties are airén, garnacha tinta, bobal, monastrell, tempranillo, xarel-lo, macabeo,
palomino fino, pedro ximénez and parellada.
Spain's wine regions are: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Cantabria,
Galicia, Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, Ceuta, Valencia, Extremadura, La Rioja, Madrid,
Melilla, Murcia, Basque Country.

## Local wine from Alpujarra

In any shop, bar or restaurant, you will find a large selection of wines from the biggest, best-known
producers, such as Rioja, Ribera del Duero, Valdepenas, La Mancha and others. However, we are mainly
concerned with local wine. In this case, local will mean wine from the Alpujarra, Sierra Nevada, the
bodegas and vineyards and bodegas closest to the coast. In this case, too, we have quite a choice. These
are usually wines from small family-run vineyards, are often characterised by original coupage, taste,
aroma, have their own specificity and feel the passion of the vineyard owners.
We can buy such wines in local shops, not only in specialised wine shops, but also in delicatessens selling
meat, cold cuts and cheese. Such shops are almost everywhere. We can also taste local wine in some
catering establishments. The average price of a bottle of such wine is between €7 and €15, although there
are also more expensive ones.

Wine tasting events organised by wineries and bodegas are great fun for wine lovers.
For the tasting, I chose a wine from the bodega Cuatro Vientos in Alpujarra. Marques de la Contraviesa,
which is an interesting coupage of Pinot Noir and Merlot. It is a light wine with an fruit aroma and
flavour. A very interesting proposition. I bought the wine in a local shop, it cost €11.

#### Classifications of Spanish wines

Joven - young wines, mostly sold between the first and second year after harvest. In addition to wines that
are genuinely light and simple, higher-end wines are increasingly finding their way here, deliberately aged
for shorter periods to retain more fruitiness, juiciness and freshness.
Roble - wines that have been matured in barrels for several months.
Crianza - wines matured for at least two years, of which a minimum of six months in oak barrels (in some
appellations, such as Rioja or Ribera del Duero, the whole year). White and rosé wines are matured for
1.5 years, of which half a year in barrels, and can come to market 2 years after harvest.

Reserva - wines matured for at least 3 years, including at least 1 year in oak barrel and 2 years in bottles.
White and rosé wines are matured for 1.5 years, of which at least half a year in barrels, but can go to
market in the third year after harvest.
Gran reserva - wines aged for at least 5 years, of which a minimum of 1.5 years in oak barrels. White and
rosé wines are aged for 4 years, of which at least six months in barrels.
